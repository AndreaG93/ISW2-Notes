\section{\texttt{org.apache.bookkeeper.util.DiskChecker} analysis}

According to our defect prediction model, \texttt{DiskChecker}\footnote{\texttt{org.apache.bookkeeper.util.DiskChecker}} class was reported as a \textit{buggy} therefore, since it is likely that it exhibits a defect, we have focused on aforementioned class in order to check if there are any errors in it, attempting to increase the \textit{reliability} of the class, that is the probability of failure free execution of that class under given conditions.

Our testing activity has confirmed our defect prediction because, using our test set $T_1$ which is retrievable from commit \texttt{bdf2fc28d2}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/AndreaG93/ISW2-bookkeeper/tree/bdf2fc28d216b0adf9e467cfb51c4f334e84d5c9}}, was reported that up to $5$ unit tests have failed, out of a total of $31$, revealing the presence of several bugs. In following subsection we will describe how we have build test set $T_1$.

\subsection{Equivalence Class Partitioning}

In order to build our test set $T_1$, we have adopted a \textit{black box} testing technique called \textit{equivalence class partitioning}, according to which the domain of possible input data for each input data element is divided
into \textit{equivalence classes}. An equivalence class is a set of data values that the tester assumes are processed in the same way by the test object \cite{FoundationSoftwareTesting}.

Although equivalence class definition is based on specifications (of requirements) only \cite{FoundationSoftwareTesting}, we have defined our test looking the code too, due to the lack of specification about \texttt{DiskChecker} class.

\subsubsection{\texttt{DiskChecker(float, float)}}

Obliviously, that method represent the constructor of \texttt{DiskChecker} class, which manage directories belonging to ledger entities. 

According to bookkeeper specification\footnote{\url{https://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/4.7.3/reference/config/}}, is possible to specify, for each ledger directory, a maximum disk space (\texttt{diskUsageThreshold}) which can be used. Moreover is possible to set a warning threshold for disk usage (\texttt{diskUsageWarnThreshold}). Specification establishes 

\vspace{5pt}
\say{\textit{that valid values should be in between $0$ and $1$ (exclusive).}}
\vspace{5pt}

For both thresholds, bookkeeper specifications establish a default value, which is equal to $0,95$. In table \ref{tab:DiskCheckerEqClass} all found equivalence classes, both for valid ($vEC$) and invalid input ($iEC$) , are been reported, including respective representative values necessary to build our test set. 

The next step is to combine the values to test cases. From a methodological point of view, to guarantee that all test object reactions are triggered, we have combined representative values using following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The representative value of all valid equivalence classes have been combined to test cases (\textit{valid/positive test case}), meaning that all possible combinations of valid equivalence classes will be covered. 
\item The representative value of an invalid equivalence class have been combined only with representatives of other valid equivalence classes (\textit{invalid/negative test case}).
\end{enumerate}

Generally, since even a few parameters can generate hundreds of valid test cases, o reduce the number of tests, we have adopted following rules

\begin{enumerate}
\item Test cases including boundary values combinations are preferred.
\item Every representative of an equivalence class appears in at least one test case.
\item Representatives of invalid equivalence classes should not be combined with representatives of other invalid equivalence classes.
\end{enumerate}

Using the previously given rules, we get $1 \times 1 = 1$ valid test cases (by combining the representatives of the valid equivalence classes) and $1 + 3 = 4$ negative test cases
(by separately testing representatives of every invalid class). Since test cases belonging to both $iEC_3$ of  \texttt{threshold} parameter and $iEC_1$ of \texttt{warnThreshold} overlap, in total $4$ test cases result from the $6$ equivalence classes.

\section{Adequacy Criteria}

\subsection{Statement coverage}

Our test set $T$ is able to cover up to $85$ statements out of a total of $89$, reaching, according to Sonarcloud report, a \textit{statement coverage} equal to \textbf{0,955} (\textbf{95,5\%}).

However we believe that \texttt{DiskChecker} class contains several statements that we can consider as \textbf{unreachable} because they fall on an \textit{infeasible path}, that is a path that would never be reached by our test set $T$ with any type of input data; to be more precise, we believe that  \texttt{setDiskSpaceThreshold(float, float)} method contains up to $4$ unreachable statements. 

Generally, in order to identify unreachable statements, drawing the flow-graph of the developed code and finding out the path that would never be reached is required, however we can consider as unreachable all statements of \texttt{setDiskSpaceThreshold(float, float)} method owing to following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{setDiskSpaceThreshold(float, float)} method is \textbf{never used} in the project, that is it is never called by any other method.
\item \texttt{setDiskSpaceThreshold(float, float)} method has \textbf{no access modifier} (\textit{package private}) which means, according to Java language specification, that it is only accessible within classes in the same package, therefore that method is not visible by any test set (we are assuming that test code, generally located into \texttt{/test} directory, is always included into a different package respect to application code, which is conversely located into \texttt{/main} directory)
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, we can conclude by stating that:

\begin{equation} 
\textbf{Statement Coverage} = \dfrac{\abs{S_c}}{\abs{S_e} - \abs{S_i}} = \dfrac{85}{89-4} = 1 = 100\%
\end{equation}

Since statement coverage of $T$ is $1$, we can consider $T$ as \textbf{adequate with respect to the statement coverage criterion}.

\subsection{Decision coverage (Branch decision coverage)}

According to \cite{FoundationSoftwareTesting}, a \textit{decision} is considered covered if the flow of control has been diverted to all possible destinations that correspond to this decision, i.e. all outcomes of the decision have been taken. This implies that, for example, the expression in the \texttt{if} or \texttt{while} statement has evaluated to \texttt{true} in some execution and to \texttt{false} in the same or another execution. Note that each \texttt{if} and each \texttt{while} contribute to \textit{one} decision whereas a \texttt{switch} may contribute to more than one.

According to our analysis, \texttt{DiskChecker} class contains 14 possible decisions, therefore $\abs{D_e} = 14$ where $D_e$ is the set of decisions in the program. Our test set $T$ can cover all decision, therefore $\abs{D_c} = 14$, where $D_c$ is the set of decisions covered.

\begin{equation} 
\textbf{Decision Coverage} = \dfrac{\abs{D_c}}{\abs{D_e} - \abs{D_i}} = \dfrac{14}{14-0} = 1 = 100\%
\end{equation}

Since decision coverage of $T$ is $1$, we can consider $T$ as \textbf{adequate with respect to the decision coverage criterion}.

\subsection{Condition coverage}

Unlike decision coverage, condition coverage ensures that each simple condition within a compound condition has assumed both values \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}. 

Le be given:

\begin{description}
\item[$C_e$] the set of simple conditions in the program.
\item[$C_c$] the set of of simple conditions covered  by our test set $T$.
\item[$C_i$] the set infeasible simple conditions.
\end{description}

According to \texttt{JaCoCo} and sonarcloud reports, our test set $T$ covers up to $46$ simple conditions, out of a total of $46$, while $\abs{C_i} = 0$. Therefore we can say that:

\begin{equation} 
\textbf{Condition Coverage} = \dfrac{\abs{C_c}}{\abs{C_e} - \abs{C_i}} = \dfrac{46}{46-0} = 1 = 100\%
\end{equation}

Since condition coverage is equal to $1$, our test set $T$ is adequate with respect to the condition coverage criterion.
