\section{Introduction}

In this report we will describe all results and issues about the utilization of several \textit{testing techniques} involving following open source projects:

\begin{description}
\item[Apache BookKeeper\texttrademark]Which is a scalable, fault tolerant and low latency storage service\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper}}.
\item[Apache OpenJPA\texttrademark]An implementation of the Java Persistence API specification\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apache/openjpa}}. 
\end{description}

To be more precise, the aim of this report is to analyse $2$ classes of each aforementioned project, attempting both to find if there are any errors in it and to increase our confidence in the correct functioning of the \textbf{software under test} (\textbf{SUT}), although the completeness of our testing does not necessarily demonstrate that these classes are error free.

\subsection{Class selection}

To select classes for our testing activities, we have mainly relied on results elaborated by our \textbf{defect prediction model}, developed using \textbf{Weka} \footnote{\url{https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/}} machine learning software, using a \textit{random forests} classifier without \textit{sampling} or \textit{feature selection}. 

Particularly, we have focused on classes marked as \textit{defective} (or \textit{buggy}) by our predictor because it is likely that they exhibit a defect observable by our test sets. As known, this approach is able to \textit{reduce the cost of testing}, by letting to focus on specific classes, ignoring stable ones \cite{Falessi}.

In particular, for our testing activities involving Apache BookKeeper\texttrademark, we have choose following classes:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{DefaultEnsemblePlacementPolicy}]\footnote{\texttt{org.apache.bookkeeper.client.DefaultEnsemblePlacementPolicy}} Because it has been marked as defective by our prediction model and, as we will see later, our testing activity has confirmed that prediction.
\item[\texttt{DiskChecker}]\footnote{\texttt{org.apache.bookkeeper.util.DiskChecker}} Although has not been marked as defective, we have choose this class due to its relative high LOC value ($294$), high number of revisions ($11$) and high number of authors ($9$). Despite its presumed stability, our testing activity have found several defects inside that class. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Testing technique}

In order to build our test set, we have adopted a testing technique called \textit{equivalence class partitioning}, according to which the domain of possible input data for each input data element is divided
into \textbf{equivalence classes}; an equivalence class is a set of data values that the tester assumes are processed in the same way by the test object \cite{FoundationSoftwareTesting}. 

Equivalence class definition was been mainly based on \textit{specifications} of our test objects using, therefore, a \textit{black-box} approach; however, sometimes, due to lacking of detailed specifications, we have performed our analysis looking the code too, using conversely a \textbf{while-box} approach. 

For any equivalence classes is important to find a \textbf{representative}. As known, testing one representative of the equivalence class is considered sufficient because it is assumed that for any other input value of the same equivalence class, the test object will show the same reaction or behaviour \cite{FoundationSoftwareTesting}. Besides equivalence classes for \textit{correct} input, those for \textit{incorrect} input values must be tested as well.

To guarantee that all test object reactions are triggered, we have combined representative values using following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The representative value of all valid equivalence classes have been combined to test cases (\textit{valid/positive test case}), meaning that all possible combinations of valid equivalence classes will be covered. 
\item The representative value of an invalid equivalence class have been combined only with representatives of other valid equivalence classes (\textit{invalid/negative test case}).
\end{enumerate}

Moreover, we have adopted following guidelines\cite{FoundationSoftwareTesting}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Test cases including boundary values combinations are preferred.
\item Every representative of an equivalence class appears in at least one test case.
\item Representatives of invalid equivalence classes should not be combined with representatives of other invalid equivalence classes.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Apache Bookkeeper\texttrademark}
\subsection{\texttt{DefaultEnsemblePlacementPolicy} class testing analysis}

What are responsibilities of \texttt{DefaultEnsemblePlacementPolicy} class? What meant by \texttt{ensemble}? And what for \texttt{placement policy}?

According to bookkeeper specifications\cite{BookKeeperArchitecture}, an \textbf{ensemble} represents a group of \textbf{bookies} storing \textbf{entries}. To be more precise, according to bookkeeper's nomenclature, a \textbf{bookie} is an individual storage server while \textbf{entries} represent stored data, therefore an ensemble of size $E$ represents simply a group of storage servers.

The aim of this design is to guarantee \textbf{consistency} in an ensemble of bookies of all stored data exploiting a \textbf{quorum-based replicated-write} protocol. As known, to support replicated writes at multiple replicas of a file, a client must first contact at least half the servers plus one (a majority) and get them to agree to do the update\cite{Tanenbaum}. Technically, in order to modify a file, a client needs to assemble the so called \textbf{write quorum}, that is an arbitrary collection of servers which must be more than the half of all available servers\cite{Tanenbaum}. Therefore, using bookkeeper's nomenclature, the size of write quorum $Q_w$ represents the number of bookies where each entry is written. 

According to bookKeeper protocol\cite{BookKeeperProtocol}, the following invariant must hold:

\begin{equation}
E \geqslant Q_w \geqslant Q_a
\end{equation}

In other word, the ensemble size $E$ must be larger than the write quorum size $Q_w$, which must in turn be larger than the so called \textbf{ack quorum size} $Q_a$, which represents, instead, the number of nodes an entry must be acknowledged on. 

BookKeeper uses several algorithms to selects a number of bookies from a cluster to build an ensemble compliant to above specifications, some of which are capable to exploit several network topology proprieties too. 

According to BookKeeper design, the implementations of these algorithm must be compliant to \texttt{EnsemblePlacementPolicy} interface \cite{EnsemblePlacementPolicy}; in other words, any implementation must respect a specific \textit{contract}, established by aforementioned interface, which covers aspects related to initialization and bookie selection for data placement and reads\cite{EnsemblePlacementPolicy}. 

Currently there are 3 implementations available by default. They are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{DefaultEnsemblePlacementPolicy}
\item \texttt{RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy}
\item \texttt{RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy}
\end{itemize}

In particular, \texttt{DefaultEnsemblePlacementPolicy} class encapsulates the simplest algorithm for bookie selection for ensemble creation because it, simply, picks bookies randomly in order to build an ensemble. 

\subsection{\texttt{DiskChecker} class testing analysis}

According to BookKeeper's documentation, \texttt{DiskChecker} class is used to provide several utility functions for checking disk problems, managing all directories belonging to \textbf{ledgers}, which represents the basic unit of storage in BookKeeper\cite{BookKeeperArchitecture}. 

Specifications establishes that, for each ledger directory, is possible to specify a maximum disk space $D$ which can be used and a, so-called, warning threshold $D_w$ for disk usage\cite{BookKeeperConfiguration}. In particular, the following invariant must hold:

\begin{eqnarray}
0  <  & D &  <  1 \nonumber \\
D_w  \leq  & D & 
\end{eqnarray}

However, for both thresholds, BookKeeper's specifications establish a default value, which is equal to $0.95$. 

Using out test set $T_1$, which is retrievable from commit \texttt{bdf2fc28d2}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/AndreaG93/ISW2-bookkeeper/tree/bdf2fc28d216b0adf9e467cfb51c4f334e84d5c9}}, our testing activity reports that up to $5$ unit tests have failed, out of a total of $31$, revealing the presence of several bugs, despite its stability according to our prediction model. In following subsections, we will describe how we have build our test sets.









\subsubsection{\texttt{DiskChecker(float, float)}}

Obliviously, that method represent the constructor of \texttt{DiskChecker} class, which manage directories belonging to ledger entities. 

Using the previously given rules, we get $1 \times 1 = 1$ valid test cases (by combining the representatives of the valid equivalence classes) and $1 + 3 = 4$ negative test cases
(by separately testing representatives of every invalid class). Since test cases belonging to both $iEC_3$ of  \texttt{threshold} parameter and $iEC_1$ of \texttt{warnThreshold} overlap, in total $4$ test cases result from the $6$ equivalence classes.

\subsection{Adequacy Criteria}

\subsubsection{Statement coverage}

Our test set $T$ is able to cover up to $85$ statements out of a total of $89$, reaching, according to Sonarcloud report, a \textit{statement coverage} equal to \textbf{0,955} (\textbf{95,5\%}).

However we believe that \texttt{DiskChecker} class contains several statements that we can consider as \textbf{unreachable} because they fall on an \textit{infeasible path}, that is a path that would never be reached by our test set $T$ with any type of input data; to be more precise, we believe that  \texttt{setDiskSpaceThreshold(float, float)} method contains up to $4$ unreachable statements. 

Generally, in order to identify unreachable statements, drawing the flow-graph of the developed code and finding out the path that would never be reached is required, however we can consider as unreachable all statements of \texttt{setDiskSpaceThreshold(float, float)} method owing to following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{setDiskSpaceThreshold(float, float)} method is \textbf{never used} in the project, that is it is never called by any other method.
\item \texttt{setDiskSpaceThreshold(float, float)} method has \textbf{no access modifier} (\textit{package private}) which means, according to Java language specification, that it is only accessible within classes in the same package, therefore that method is not visible by any test set (we are assuming that test code, generally located into \texttt{/test} directory, is always included into a different package respect to application code, which is conversely located into \texttt{/main} directory)
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, we can conclude by stating that:

\begin{equation} 
\textbf{Statement Coverage} = \dfrac{\abs{S_c}}{\abs{S_e} - \abs{S_i}} = \dfrac{85}{89-4} = 1 = 100\%
\end{equation}

Since statement coverage of $T$ is $1$, we can consider $T$ as \textbf{adequate with respect to the statement coverage criterion}.

\subsubsection{Decision coverage (Branch decision coverage)}

According to \cite{FoundationSoftwareTesting}, a \textit{decision} is considered covered if the flow of control has been diverted to all possible destinations that correspond to this decision, i.e. all outcomes of the decision have been taken. This implies that, for example, the expression in the \texttt{if} or \texttt{while} statement has evaluated to \texttt{true} in some execution and to \texttt{false} in the same or another execution. Note that each \texttt{if} and each \texttt{while} contribute to \textit{one} decision whereas a \texttt{switch} may contribute to more than one.

According to our analysis, \texttt{DiskChecker} class contains 14 possible decisions, therefore $\abs{D_e} = 14$ where $D_e$ is the set of decisions in the program. Our test set $T$ can cover all decision, therefore $\abs{D_c} = 14$, where $D_c$ is the set of decisions covered.

\begin{equation} 
\textbf{Decision Coverage} = \dfrac{\abs{D_c}}{\abs{D_e} - \abs{D_i}} = \dfrac{14}{14-0} = 1 = 100\%
\end{equation}

Since decision coverage of $T$ is $1$, we can consider $T$ as \textbf{adequate with respect to the decision coverage criterion}.

\subsubsection{Condition coverage}

Unlike decision coverage, condition coverage ensures that each simple condition within a compound condition has assumed both values \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}. 

Le be given:

\begin{description}
\item[$C_e$] the set of simple conditions in the program.
\item[$C_c$] the set of of simple conditions covered  by our test set $T$.
\item[$C_i$] the set infeasible simple conditions.
\end{description}

According to \texttt{JaCoCo} and sonarcloud reports, our test set $T$ covers up to $46$ simple conditions, out of a total of $46$, while $\abs{C_i} = 0$. Therefore we can say that:

\begin{equation} 
\textbf{Condition Coverage} = \dfrac{\abs{C_c}}{\abs{C_e} - \abs{C_i}} = \dfrac{46}{46-0} = 1 = 100\%
\end{equation}

Since condition coverage is equal to $1$, our test set $T$ is adequate with respect to the condition coverage criterion.

 According to method signature, if  not enough bookies are available to build an ensemble of size \texttt{ensembleSize}, a \texttt{BKNotEnoughBookiesException} is thrown.

. Morevoer, 

Choose numBookies bookies for ensemble. If the count is more than the number of available nodes, BKException.BKNotEnoughBookiesException is thrown.

The implementation should respect to the replace settings. The size of the returned bookie list should be equal to the provide ensembleSize. 


The @NotNull Annotation is, actually, an explicit contract declaring the following:

A method should not return null.
A variable (like fields, local variables, and parameters) cannot should not hold null value.
