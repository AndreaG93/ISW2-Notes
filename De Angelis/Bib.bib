abstract = {The ISTQB Certified Tester exam was developed toward an international standard which includes 47 international testing boards. Today more than 130,000 people have taken the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) Foundations Level exam. So, where can all these people go to learn what they need to know in order to pass the exam? Now they can go to Software Testing Foundations, 3rd Edition, from Rocky Nook's Computing division. Professional testing of software has become an increasingly important task that requires a profound knowledge of testing techniques. The ISTQB has developed a universally accepted, international qualification scheme aimed at software and system testing professionals, and has created the syllabi and the tests for the "Certified Tester." With authors who are among the founders of the Certified Tester Syllabus, this thoroughly revised and updated 3rd Edition covers the "Foundations Level" (i.e., entry level) and teaches the most important methods of software testing. It is designed for self-study and provides the knowledge necessary to pass the Certified Tester: Foundations Level exam as defined by the ISTQB. Additionally, in this new edition, technical terms have been stated more precisely according to the revised and uptated ISTQB glossary.}
